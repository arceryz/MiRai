# Mirai

Mirai is a W.I.P tool for my Bachelor's Thesis that computes mirror reflections in 2D and 3D of straight and curved mirror's. It then draws the image points in world space to observe alignment of mirror patterns in both 2D and 3D.

Features
- [] 2D (Mirai 1.0) mirror visualiser.
- [] 3D mirror visualiser.
- [] Enhanced user interface.
- [] Fancy rendering options.
